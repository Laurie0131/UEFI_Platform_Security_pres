<p align="center"><span class="gold" ><b>Why is Platform Firmware Security Important ?</b></span></p>

Note:
If we think of FW like plumbing
It needs to  standardized to simplify implementation  (Fitting the pieces of pipe together like standardized plumbing PVC Pipe)
Where we have the Hardware,  the Firmware,  and then hand off to the OS

When we look at why firmware security is important, using the analogy of the plumbing pipeline,
If we are were to run water through this imaginary pipe we would want to know that the water source could be trusted
With Security it is important to establish the root of trust and that we can validated that root of trust.
And it needs to be scalable to work across a variety of needs

New Ideas – new features - 
Dog do-do - Protect from outside attacks. Protect from Things not intended to be put into the firmware

Firmware needs to be done correctly from the get -go
