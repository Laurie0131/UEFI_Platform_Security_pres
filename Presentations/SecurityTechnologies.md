@title[Boot Security Technologies]
<p align="right"><span class="gold" ><b>Boot Security Technologies</b></span></p>

Note:

##### Intel Boot Guard: 
- When your CPU starts up, it reads some code out of flash and executes it. With Intel Boot Guard, the CPU verifies a signature on that flash code before executing the reset vector

##### Intel TXT - Trusted Execution Technology 

##### Secure Boot
- In a Secure Boot chain, each step in the process checks a cryptographic signature on the executable of the next step before it’s launched. Thus, the BIOS will check a signature on the loader, and the loader will check signatures on all the kernel objects that it loads. The objects in the chain are usually signed by the software manufacturer, using private keys that match up with public keys already in the BIOS. If any of the software modules in the boot chain have been hacked, then the signatures won’t match, and the device won’t boot the image.Because the images must be signed by the manufacturer, it’s generally impractical to sign any files generated by the platform user (such as config files).

- Secure Boot is relatively self-contained. If the handful of signed objects haven’t been tampered with, the platform boots, and secure boot is done. If objects have been changed so the signature is no longer valid, the platform doesn’t boot and a re-installation is indicated.


##### Measured Boot
- In a Measured Boot chain, we still depend on a Root of Trust as the starting point for a chain of trust. But in this case, prior to launching the next object, the currently-running object “measures” or computes the hash of, the next object(s) in the chain, and stores the hashes in a way that they can be securely retrieved later to find out what objects were encountered. Measured Boot doesn’t make an implicit value judgement as to good or bad, and it doesn’t stop the platform from running, so Measured Boot can be much more liberal about what it checks. This can include all kinds of platform configuration information such as which was the boot device, what was in the loader config file, or anything else that might be of interest.

- Measured Boot is more flexible, but also requires an important step... Somehow all those hashes have to be stored in a way that there’s very little chance that they can be manipulated, and a very high likelihood that they can be reliably reported to a management station, using a process called Attestation. Since Measured Boot doesn’t stop the platform from booting, the host OS can’t be relied upon to report the hashes.
 
- In the case of Measure Boot, the Trusted Platform Module is used to record these hashes. The TPM is a small self-contained security processor that can be attached to a system bus as a simple peripheral. (See http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Security-Now/What-is-a-Trusted-Platform-Module-TPM/ba-p/281128 for more on TPM technology.)  Of the many functions a TPM can provide, one is the facility called Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), used for storing hashes.

- PCRs are registers in the TPM that are cleared only at hardware reset, and cannot be directly written

@title[Hardware root of Trust ]
<p align="right"><span class="gold" ><b>Hardware root of Trust </b></span></p>

Note:
##### Intel Boot Guard: 
- With Intel Boot Guard, the CPU verifies a signature on flash code before executing. The hash of the public half of the signing key is flashed into fuses on the CPU. It is the system vendor that owns this key and chooses to flash it into the CPU, not Intel. 
- This has genuine security benefits. It's no longer possible for an attacker to simply modify or replace the firmware - they have to find some other way to trick it into executing arbitrary code, and over time these will be closed off. But in the process, the system vendor has prevented the user from being able to make an informed choice to replace their system firmware


##### Intel TXT Trusted Execution Technology 
- TXT - uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and cryptographic techniques to provide measurements of software and platform components so that system software as well as local and remote management applications may use those measurements to make trust decisions. This technology is based on an industry initiative by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) to promote safer computing. It defends against software-based attacks aimed at stealing sensitive information by corrupting system or BIOS code, or modifying the platform's configuration.

- This slide is using the boot flow and pointing out the different boot security technologies

- In the slide, the platform hardware complex will provide logic to verify that the ensuing BIOS storage container meets the policy of the platform supplier. 
- Once this restart time verification occurs, the Platform Supplier (PS)  Platform Init (PI) code, such as the UEFI PEI phase, is responsible for ensuring that the rest of the Platform Supplier (PS) code meets policy. Today, the hardware action is Platform Supplier  and/or Hardware-supplier specific, and the ‘middle’ verification is Platform Supplier  specification. 

- In measured boot, a record of the code execution is provided into the PCR’s (in the TPM) but no policy decisions are enacted. Secure Boot, on the other hand, enforces policy prior to the execution of content. The code that implements the Secure Boot logic is known alternatively as a Root of Trust for Verification (RTV) or Root of Trust for Enforcement (RTE). 
- The RTV can be a hardware embodiment that  verifies the UEFI PI firmware prior to passing control or 

- it can be implemented in UEFI for purposes of providing platform owner control of UEFI 3rd party executables. 

- The later is described in this slide

@title[UEFI Secure Boot Flow ]
<p align="right"><span class="gold" ><b>UEFI Secure Boot Flow</b></span></p>

Note:
- UEFI Secure Boot defines how a platform’s firmware can authenticate a digitally signed UEFI image, such as an operating system loader or a UEFI driver stored in an option ROM. This provides the capability to ensure that those UEFI images are only loaded in an owner-authorized fashion and provides a common means to ensure platforms security and integrity over systems running UEFI-based firmware. 

- At a high level, the platform manufacturer or the platform owner are the administrative role on the left of this slide. They will enroll the policy objects, which include the n-tuple of keys {PK, KEK, db, dbx} as a step 1. During each successive boot, the UEFI Secure boot implementation will assess the policy in order to verify the signed images that are discovered in a host-bus adapter or on a disk. If the images pass policy, then they are invoked.

Note:

- Source: Intel 7 Series Chipset PCH datasheet : http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/7-series-chipset-pch-datasheet.pdf

Bullets:
- Access controlled by the Peripheral Controller Hub (PCH)
- Flash Memory  - Direct access to physical address space is programed through SPI MMIO registers
- SPI Flash Descriptor  - Access Control table defines which masters (CPU, ME, GbE) can access which regions


- Where is BIOS Firmware Memory located?

##### SPI Flash Descriptor
- Region 0 at FLA 0 – FFFh (4 KB)
- Signature: 0FF0A55Ah at 10h LBA
- Contains the following sections:
  - Component: flash device configuration
  - Region: describes other regions
  - Master: defines Rd/Wr Access Control table
  - CPU and PCH soft straps
  - ME VSCC Table: JEDEC ID & VSCC info
  - OEM: reserved for OEM use
- Access Control table defines which masters (CPU, ME, GbE) can access which regions

##### Flash Descriptor has to be write-protected


- The maximum size of the Flash Descriptor is 4 KB. If the block/sector size of the SPI
flash device is greater than 4 KB, the flash descriptor will only use the first 4 KB of the
first block. The flash descriptor requires its own block at the bottom of memory (00h).
The information stored in the Flash Descriptor can only be written during the
manufacturing process as its read/write permissions must be set to Read only when the
computer leaves the manufacturing floor.

@title[Signed Firmware Update]
<p align="right"><span class="gold" ><b>Signed Firmware Update</b></span></p>

Note:
- The RTU is protected by the OEM proprietary flash locking mechanisms at the hardware level and all updates to the RTU must be signed. 
- In this implementation, the BIOS key store includes the full public key used to verify the signature of all BIOS and firmware updates. This public key can be injected into the BIOS update executable during the BIOS signing process but is only programmed into the RTU during an authenticated RTU update. This can coincide with a normal BIOS update when needed. 
- All BIOS update images are signed using the RSA PKCS #1 v2.1 algorithm with RSA 2048-bit keys as per FIPS Publication 186-3 Digital Signature Standard (DSS). The SHA-256 algorithm was selected to hash the payload in the signing and verification process based on this algorithm’s acceptance in NIST Special Publication 800-131A. Update images are verified by the BIOS using the public key contained in the RTU before the BIOS or other firmware currently running on the system is modified.

Note:
- This slide shows  The FMP capsule image format.
- It contains the update FMP drivers and the FMP payloads. The FMP payload contains the binary update image and optional vendor code. The platform may consume a FMP protocol to update the firmware image.
 

- The UEFI specification [UEFI] defines UEFI capsule services, EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL, FMP capsule format and EFI System Resource Table (ESRT) to support system firmware and device firmware update.
 
- The platform may consume a system FMP and a device FMP protocol to get the firmware image information and report the ESRT to a UEFI OS.
 
- An OS agent may call the UEFI service UpdateCapsule() to pass the capsule image from the OS to the firmware. Based upon the capsule flags, the firmware may process the capsule image immediately, or the firmware may reset the system and process the capsule image on the next boot.

Note:

- Source: UEFI Spec Version 2.4 Facilitates Secure Update UEFI Summerfest – July 15‐19, 2013  http://uefi.org/

##### Capsule update is a runtime service used to update UEFI FW

- This is a look at memory of the capsule update process

- Update is initiated by update application/OS run‐time

- Update application stores update “capsule” in DRAM or HDD on ESP (e.g. \EFI\CapsuleUpdate)
- The EFI system partition (ESP) is a partition on a data storage device (usually a hard disk drive or solid-state drive) that is used by computers adhering to the UEFI Spec (FAT File System)

- Upon reboot or S3 resume, FW finds and parses update capsule

- After FW verifies digital signature of the capsule, FW writes new BIOS FV(s) to SPI flash memory

- The EFI system partition (ESP) is a partition on a data storage device (usually a hard disk drive or solid-state drive) that is used by computers adhering to the UEFI Spec (FAT File System)

- This slide shows BIOS Guard address SMM vulnerabilities by strengthening the update trust boundary.


- For runtime BIOS Update (e.g. on server platforms), all complex SMI handlers code is in the trust boundary of the firmware update
- Different systems have different SMI handlers which makes it difficult to ensure consistent security level of SMI code across all system and security level of firmware update
- BIOS Guard reduces SMI handler attack surface, using one signed BIOS Guard authenticated code module (ACM)
- Platforms enabling BIOS Guard only need to use one module for a given processor generation

- BIOS Guard module is authenticated code module (ACM) executing in internal processor AC RAM
- When BIOS Guard is enabled, only BIOS Guard module is able to write to system SPI flash memory
- BIOS Guard verifies the signature of a firmware update package signed by a platform manufacturer prior to writing to system SPI flash memory
